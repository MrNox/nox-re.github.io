## About me

Hey there! My name is Josu√© aka Nox - I've started in the reversing world since my last year of high school in 2007 :D. In my beginnings I did reversing without knowing it is called 'reversing' and I read a lot of pages of assembly until I dared to do a little ASM program. Some time later I won my first 200USD with 15k downloads in a week for a Rakion's cheat bot I programmed building C++ code in ASM.
<br/>

That's is only the beginning of my adventure ...
<br/>

I wrote many stuffs in spanish and the latest years I started it in english. This blog tries to recopile and sort everithing I've done so far, researchs, tells some histories and shows my infosec talks.

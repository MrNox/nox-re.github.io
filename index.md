## About me

<p class="message">
  Hey there! My name is Josu√© aka Nox - I've started in the reversing world since my last year of high school in 2007 :D cheating in Rakion, doing reversing without knowing it is calling 'reversing', winning my first 250USD with 15k downloads in a week for a Rakion's cheat bot I programmed in ASM. 
<br/>
That's is only the beginning of my adventure ...
</p>

I wrote many stuffs in spanish and the latest years I started it in english. This blog tries to recopile and sort everithing I've done so far, researchs, tells some histories and shows my infosec talks.
